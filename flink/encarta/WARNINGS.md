[Warning] The primary key does not match the upsert key derived from the query. If the primary key and upsert key don't match, the system needs to add a state-intensive operation for correction. Please revisit the query, as it currently does not produce any upsert key. Grouping, partitioning, and joining operations should reference the upsert keys of the source tables. For more information, see https://cnfl.io/primary_vs_upsert_key.
[Warning] Entire statement: Your query includes one or more highly state-intensive operators but does not set a time-to-live (TTL) value, which means that the system potentially needs to store an infinite amount of state. This can result in a DEGRADED statement and higher CFU consumption. If possible, change your query to use a different operator, or set a time-to-live (TTL) value. For more information, see https://cnfl.io/high_state_intensive_operators.
