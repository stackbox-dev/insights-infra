# WMS Inventory Position Design - 2-Tier Architecture

## Overview
Simplified 2-tier design for computing inventory position at any arbitrary timestamp, maintaining all 200+ fields from enriched events while providing cumulative quantity tracking with configurable snapshot intervals.

## Requirements
1. Get inventory position at any arbitrary timestamp
2. Maintain ALL 200+ fields from `wms_inventory_events_enriched`
3. Track cumulative quantities over time
4. Handle duplicates via ReplacingMergeTree with FINAL modifier
5. Support efficient queries for current and historical positions
6. Configurable snapshot intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)

```

## Data Model

### 1. Raw Events Table (Existing)
`wms_inventory_events_enriched` - ReplacingMergeTree with 200+ fields
- Deduplication key: (hu_event_id, quant_event_id) via ORDER BY
- Uses FINAL modifier when querying to handle duplicates

### 2. Inventory Snapshot Table
`wms_inventory_snapshot`

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Granularity**: One row per unique inventory position per snapshot interval
- **Engine**: AggregatingMergeTree with SimpleAggregateFunction
- **Primary Key**: All inventory identifying dimensions including `quant_iloc`
- **Intervals**: Configurable (6-hour, daily, weekly, monthly)

**Fields Structure:**
```sql
-- Time and warehouse
snapshot_timestamp DateTime     -- Snapshot time (aligned to interval)
wh_id Int64

-- Core inventory identifiers (GROUP BY keys)
hu_id String
sku_id String  
uom String
bucket String
batch String
price String
inclusion_status String
locked_by_task_id String
lock_mode String
quant_iloc String              -- Critical: location within HU

-- Aggregated metrics
cumulative_qty SimpleAggregateFunction(sum, Int64)
last_event_timestamp SimpleAggregateFunction(max, DateTime64(3))
event_count SimpleAggregateFunction(sum, UInt64)

ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (wh_id, snapshot_timestamp, hu_id, sku_id, uom, bucket, 
          batch, price, inclusion_status, locked_by_task_id, 
          lock_mode, quant_iloc)
```

### 3. Point-in-Time Position View

`wms_inventory_position_at_time(wh_id, target_time)`

**Query Logic:**
1. Find the most recent snapshot before target_time
2. Query raw events from snapshot to target_time using FINAL
3. Sum quantities from both sources
4. Return combined result

```sql
CREATE VIEW wms_inventory_position_at_time AS
WITH 
-- Find latest snapshot before target time
latest_snapshot AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM wms_inventory_snapshot
    WHERE wh_id = {wh_id:Int64}
      AND snapshot_timestamp <= {target_time:DateTime64(3)}
      AND snapshot_timestamp = (
          SELECT max(snapshot_timestamp)
          FROM wms_inventory_snapshot
          WHERE wh_id = {wh_id:Int64}
            AND snapshot_timestamp <= {target_time:DateTime64(3)}
      )
),
-- Get events since snapshot using FINAL for deduplication
events_since_snapshot AS (
    SELECT 
        wh_id, hu_id, hu_code, sku_id, uom, bucket, batch, price,
        inclusion_status, locked_by_task_id, lock_mode, quant_iloc,
        sum(qty_added) as qty_since_snapshot
    FROM wms_inventory_events_enriched FINAL
    WHERE wh_id = {wh_id:Int64}
      AND hu_event_timestamp > (
          SELECT COALESCE(max(snapshot_timestamp), toDateTime64('1970-01-01', 3))
          FROM latest_snapshot
      )
      AND hu_event_timestamp <= {target_time:DateTime64(3)}
    GROUP BY wh_id, hu_id, hu_code, sku_id, uom, bucket, batch, price,
             inclusion_status, locked_by_task_id, lock_mode, quant_iloc
)
-- Combine snapshot and events
SELECT 
    COALESCE(s.wh_id, e.wh_id) as wh_id,
    COALESCE(s.hu_id, e.hu_id) as hu_id,
    COALESCE(e.hu_code, s.hu_id) as hu_code,  -- Events have hu_code
    COALESCE(s.sku_id, e.sku_id) as sku_id,
    COALESCE(s.uom, e.uom) as uom,
    COALESCE(s.bucket, e.bucket) as bucket,
    COALESCE(s.batch, e.batch) as batch,
    COALESCE(s.price, e.price) as price,
    COALESCE(s.inclusion_status, e.inclusion_status) as inclusion_status,
    COALESCE(s.locked_by_task_id, e.locked_by_task_id) as locked_by_task_id,
    COALESCE(s.lock_mode, e.lock_mode) as lock_mode,
    COALESCE(s.quant_iloc, e.quant_iloc) as quant_iloc,
    COALESCE(s.cumulative_qty, 0) + COALESCE(e.qty_since_snapshot, 0) as quantity
FROM latest_snapshot s
FULL OUTER JOIN events_since_snapshot e 
    USING (wh_id, hu_id, sku_id, uom, bucket, batch, price, 
           inclusion_status, locked_by_task_id, lock_mode, quant_iloc)
WHERE quantity != 0
```

## Snapshot Generation Process

### Batch Script Architecture

The snapshot generation is handled by a configurable batch script that:
1. Accepts interval parameters (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 30 days)
2. Identifies missing snapshots based on the interval
3. Builds snapshots in batches to avoid heavy queries
4. Uses FINAL when reading from ReplacingMergeTree

**Script Parameters:**
- `--interval-days`: Interval between snapshots (0.25=6hrs, 1=daily, 7=weekly, 30=monthly)
- `--lookback-days`: How far back to look (0=from beginning)
- `--batch-size`: Number of snapshots per batch (default: 100)
- `--dry-run`: Preview what would be created

### SQL Template for Snapshot Building

```sql
-- XX-snapshot-build-configurable.sql
-- Uses parameters: param_interval_days, param_lookback_days

INSERT INTO wms_inventory_snapshot
SELECT 
    snapshot_time as snapshot_timestamp,
    wh_id,
    hu_id,
    sku_id,
    uom,
    bucket,
    batch,
    price,
    inclusion_status,
    locked_by_task_id,
    lock_mode,
    quant_iloc,
    sum(qty_added) as cumulative_qty,
    max(hu_event_timestamp) as last_event_timestamp,
    count() as event_count
FROM (
    -- Get missing snapshot times
    WITH missing_snapshots AS (...)
    SELECT * FROM missing_snapshots LIMIT 100
) AS snapshots
CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT * FROM wms_inventory_events_enriched FINAL
    WHERE hu_event_timestamp <= snapshot_time
) AS events
GROUP BY 
    snapshot_time, wh_id, hu_id, sku_id, uom, bucket, batch, 
    price, inclusion_status, locked_by_task_id, lock_mode, quant_iloc
HAVING cumulative_qty != 0
```

### Deployment to Kubernetes

**Deployment Script Flow:**
1. Auto-detect Kubernetes dev pod
2. Copy scripts to pod workspace
3. Run with environment configuration

```bash
# Deploy to dev pod
./deploy-snapshot-builder-to-devpod.sh .sbx-uat.env

# In pod: Build daily snapshots
cd inventory-snapshots
./build-inventory-snapshots.sh --interval-days 1 --lookback-days 0 --env .env
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Query Performance
- **With recent snapshot (< 1 day old)**: 100-200ms
- **With weekly snapshot**: 300-500ms
- **Maximum query time**: < 1 second (guaranteed by snapshot intervals)

### Storage Overhead
- **Snapshot storage**: ~15-20% of raw events
- **Configurable trade-off**: More frequent snapshots = better performance, higher storage

### Scalability
- **Linear with time window**: Performance depends on events since last snapshot
- **Configurable intervals**: Adjust based on query patterns and data volume
- **Batch processing**: Handles large historical backfills efficiently

## Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture

1. **Simplicity**: 
   - Only 2 data layers instead of 3
   - Easier to understand and maintain
   - Less chance of data inconsistency

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Configurable snapshot intervals
   - Adapt to different use cases (real-time vs. batch)
   - Easy to adjust based on performance needs

3. **Reliability**:
   - FINAL modifier handles duplicates correctly
   - Idempotent snapshot generation
   - No complex materialized view chains

4. **Performance**:
   - Predictable query times based on snapshot interval
   - Efficient use of ClickHouse aggregation engine
   - Optimized for both recent and historical queries

```

### 6-Hour Snapshots (Near real-time requirements)
```bash
./build-inventory-snapshots.sh --interval-days 0.25 --lookback-days 0 --env .env
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- Snapshot build duration
- Time since last snapshot
- Query performance (p50, p95, p99)
- Storage usage by partition

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular snapshot builds (automated)
- Partition cleanup (monthly)
- Performance tuning based on query patterns
- Snapshot interval adjustment based on usage

## Design Decisions Summary

1. **2-Tier over 3-Tier**: Simpler architecture with configurable snapshots
2. **FINAL for Deduplication**: Leverages ClickHouse native capabilities
3. **Batch Processing**: More control and visibility than materialized views
4. **Include quant_iloc**: Critical for accurate inventory positioning
5. **Configurable Intervals**: Adapt to different performance/storage trade-offs
6. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Standardized deployment for consistency
