#  Understanding of PRIMARY KEY and ORDER BY in clickhouse

In ClickHouse, there is no explicit PRIMARY KEY constraint like in traditional RDBMS (e.g., Postgres). However, the ORDER BY clause in MergeTree engines implicitly defines the primary key for the table's indexing structure. That said, choosing the right ORDER BY keys is essential for read and write performance, deduplication (in ReplacingMergeTree), and efficient query filtering.


ðŸš¨ **Key Points to Note:**

- ORDER BY in ReplacingMergeTree is effectively the primary index.

- The tuple you specify in ORDER BY should reflect how your queries filter the table.

- For ReplacingMergeTree, the version column (e.g., updatedAt) is NOT automatically part of the indexâ€”you must choose wisely for deduplication to work well.

- UUID values are bad for ordering/indexing due to poor localityâ€”if possible, keep them after better-clustering keys like integers or timestamps.
