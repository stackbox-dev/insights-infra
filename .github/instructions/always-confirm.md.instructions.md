## Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

NEVER DO ANYTHING WITHOUT CONFIRMATION.
Always ask for confirmation before making any changes, especially if the change involves deleting or modifying existing code.
If you are unsure about a change, ask for clarification or confirmation before proceeding.
Always confirm with the user before making any changes to the codebase, even if the change seems minor or straightforward.
If you encounter a situation where you are unsure about the implications of a change,
always err on the side of caution and seek confirmation before proceeding.
Always provide a clear explanation of the change you are proposing and why it is necessary.
